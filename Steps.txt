STEPS:

1. using beautiful soup, create tables for premier league teams, W, L, D, GF, GA, and Points. pass into template and render.
2. make table look prettier. Figure out how to add css components.

3. Make a rough sketch of page. where will the table be? where will the predicted table be? where will the score be? what else should
be added?
    --> keep real table, predicted table, color code prediction values, print overall prediction, keep relevant info for primary team. 
























META STEPS

1. get the table printed and current prediction score printed in the server. Use flask.
--> need to figure out how to use flask and print into the created host.
    --> can we only return? No. have to render through HTML. best way.
--> look into selenium - somehow flask isn't able to auto open the browser when program runs
    --> still an issue, just configured a launch.json and figured something out. But don't think I actually solved the root issue
--> figured out how to render html, make html and figure how to configure with data flask is getting
    --> Jinja?? is what I am using?? who knows???
--> can maybe just use style component for HTML, but can use CSS as well if you want.

2. work on creating a homepage, with the current table as well as current prediction score.
    --> essentially there, need to format it nicer
    --> add PLAYED, WINS, DRAWS, LOSSES, GOALS FOR, GOALS AGAINST, NEXT FIXTURE, HOME or AWAY

3. implement graph feature, score over time

4. implement users and database to store user information
    --> store user's favorite team, ask them, and then keep that in mind to check some table value. 

5. make the entire thing look very nice

6. use pandas to scrape fbref data, output it nicely. maybe add dynamic links or whatever later on. this would be a new tab.

6. create official website????

--> this is test to see if github will actually update :0
